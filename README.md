# E-Shopping-12th-Project
Simple E-Shopping project done using java swing components in Netbeans IDE. For DB details we have to change the credentials in every file using DB as this was done long before when we just started using java. A lot of repetetive code will be present presenting a similar functionality hence the huge project size. The DB used here is MySQL.
